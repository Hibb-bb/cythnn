# Describe a chunk to be processed by a specific pipe (pipeline module).
# pipeid: int that identifies the pipe to process
# priority: a task should have a priority between 0-1 (exclusive), where lower is a higher
#           priority. A task is prioritized first by a higher pipeid, then by a lower priority value.
# atiteration & atpipeid: preconditions that block processing a task until the progress arrived at (least) the given iteration and pipeid
# Tasks are full python objects, that hold additional attributes as parameters for the task.
